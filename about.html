<b>Background:</b> <br> 

<br>Growing up in Tacoma, Washington, with mountains/volcanoes, world-famous waterfalls, beaches, forests, living museums, and lava tubes within reasonable driving distance, my family and friends often took daycations during the summer to take advantage of the beautiful nature around us.
<br>Two of my favorite hikes are the <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/ape-cave">Ape Caves</a> and the <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/skyline-trail-loop">Skyline Trail</a> at Paradise Inn on Mt. Ranier. Skyline trail is like walking into a landscape painting. It was also where my friends and I had a snowball fight in 80 degree weather - yes, it is mind blowing!

<b>Texas A&M:</b> <br>

<br> In Fall 2016, I moved 2,206 miles from home to Teas A&M to study engineering. That fall I joined a <a href="https://aggiefirstrobotics.org/activities/vex">WE VEX U</a> team, working on the mechanical side. Through this team, I was introduced to the EIC (now FEDC) machine staff and shop. Spring 2017, I joined the Texas A&M engineering ENACTUS team for a semester and had the opportunity to present our innovative business plan at a competition. That spring, VEX also went to the state competition where I was one of the two drivers of our robot. I later represented VEX and WE as a WE Ambassador at a conference at the Hilton focused on introducing engineering to young girls. Fall 2017, I began volunteering at the EIC machine shop.<br> 

<br> Over my years at Texas A&M, I have worked several jobs, and a few at the same time. The jobs I have worked include a cashier at the C-Store on campus until the part time position ended in the summer, then a barista at the MSC Barnes & Noble Café until offered a position assisting with the opening of <a href="https://www.texasamhotelcc.com/">Texas A&M Hotel and Conference Center</a> and a part-time position as a concierge/front desk agent until I resigned due to class and work conflicts. Each of these I worked while also working at the Fischer Engineering Design Center, beginning when it was still the Engineering Innovation Center prior to the opening of the Zachary building. <br>

<br> At this time, I was also participating in Chi Alpha, an on campus organization and ministry. After being a member for a semester, I was invited to take their leadership training course that spring and become a leader the following fall. I have been doing that for the last two years.

<br> Summer 2018, I was able to travel to Cairo with Chi Alpha. Summer 2020, I am planning to travel to several countries in Asia with the same organization as well as do a study abroad in Spain.

<br>

<br>

<b>Today:</b> <br>

<br>As of Spring 2020, I am currently employed at the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/fedc/index.html">FEDC</a> (formerly the EIC). I have completed most of my foundational CSCE classes with the exception of Programming Studio, which is being taken this semester. I have started taking my upper level classes, which consist of a Law & Cybersecurity class and a Distributed Systems class this semester.

<br> I enjoy my leadership/mentorship position in Chi Alpha. I have recently picked up the guitar again and whenever possible, play the piano at the MSC. Because I live in a house with multiple other people, I usually practice singing to my favorite songs in my car driving to a different city. I will not discuss whether it sounds any good or not - but no one's listening.

<b>Words to Live By:</b> <br>

<br>"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters..." - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A23&version=NIV">Colossians 3:23</a> <br>

I believe in giving excellence at everything I put my hand to in order to glorify God. I don’t like stopping at "good enough".
