<br>Fall 2017, I joined 
<br><a href="http://xacollegestation.com/">Chi Alpha Texas A&M</a>, an on campus ministry. Spring 2018, my small group leader invited me to take the class to become a small group leader. I completed the class during the spring semester. Fall 2018, I began my first year as a small group leader. As a small group leader, we reach out to other students, many of whom are looking for a community to welcome them, and invite them into fellowship through relationship.

<br>For two years in highscool, I volunteered and modeled for an organization called Adorned in Grace. Adorned in Grace in a trafficking awareness organization that creates curriculums to bring awareness to the realities of trafficking and prostitution as well as teaching young girls the strategies pimps use to target them. AIG emphasizes the need to bring awareness to parents as well as middle school aged girls and older, as many traffickers specifically target middle school girls while they are most vulnerable and insecure. The organization also sells donated wedding dresses and uses the proceeds to fund rehabilitation and training projects that it also oversees, combatting the problem that most rescued girls are forced back into prostitution due to no marketable skills except their bodies.
